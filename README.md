One of the main problems in maintaining an up-to-date collection of outlandings is that it is difficult to eliminate from the waypoint files those outlandings that are not up-to-date any longer. Old ultralight fields, for example, but also fields that are not suitable any longer because of new crops (also fields that were never meant to be a decent outplanding are commonly found in waypoint files). When you merge waypoints from different sources it these "deprecated" fields have the tendency to sneak in again. To this end, I maintain a list of "wrong" waypoints; that is, outlandings that I suspect are not suitable (any longer). The list is in the file (https://github.com/setalle/Gliding/blob/main/wrong_waypoints.cup). 

If you have python, to find out whether your waypoint file contains any of the deprecated waypoints according to my list, you can use (at your own risk) the script 'wptool.py' with the command 'python wptool.py diff wrong_waypoints.cup yourfilename.cup'. See section "My script" below.

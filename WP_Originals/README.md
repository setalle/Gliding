## Sandro's Waypoints Repository

##### DISCLAIMER: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
##### DISCLAIMER 2: all statements are "IMHO"

This directory contains the sources I have used to distill my own WP files. I have added the suffix SAN after converting a file to the new seeyou format and adapting it to my own labeling method. 

##### Enemonzo
Excellent repository you can find at [CVNE](http://www.cvne.it/). They even have pictures and videos. NOTE: I have added two fields that were not in the .cup file but were present in the  the factsheets ("schede") they posted. 

##### Valbrembo
Another excellent repositorym found at the site [AVA Valbrembo](http://www.ava-valbrembo.it).

##### AVS
The file I got in 2020 from my friends in Verona. Lots of good stuff, but I am not sure how updated it is. 

##### Soaring Web France
This is excellent, from the [site](https://soaringweb.org/TP/AP_alpes), updated in 2020. There is a google earth at the [site](http://www.planeur.net/_download/divers/TERRAINS%20VACHABLES%20-%20ALPES%20FRANCAISES.kmz)
In the file `apalpsv3SAN2020.cup` I have added two fields wrt the original and changed a couple of coordinates after checking them on google earth. 

##### Seeyou
Generated in November 2020 using the seeyou waypoint generator. My feeling is that the quality is very good (I haven't found any incorrect field); but  there are only very few outlandings here. 

##### XCsoar
These are the points downloaded from (https://www.xcsoar.org/download/waypoints/)I don't trust them: I found too many 'old' fields. The other source XCsoar refers to is the one of [soaringweb](https://soaringweb.org/), which contains a bunch of different files, mostly outdated  (but not all outdated: the French file there is excellent).

##### ulm.it
This is still TBD:
